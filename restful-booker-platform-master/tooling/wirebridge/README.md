# Wirebridge

Wirebridge is a configurable API that helps teams abstract complex data creation tasks behind programmable HTTP requests.

It is currently being used with RBP as means to quickly create bookings and hotels. To find out more on how to create mappings for Wirebridge, check out its README [https://github.com/mwinteringham/wirebridge](https://github.com/mwinteringham/wirebridge)

## Setting up

To run Wirebridge, open up a terminal window and navigate to this folder and run:

```java -jar Wirebridge-0.0.1.jar```

You will see logging to show that Wirebridge is up and running.

## Using Wirebridge

Wirebridge has been configured with two mappings that you can make HTTP requests against to create a single Hotel or a single Booking per API call.

You can download the HTTP requests as a Postman collection here: [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5805c3bde8c38353bea9](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5805c3bde8c38353bea9)
